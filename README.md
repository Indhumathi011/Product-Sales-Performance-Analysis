🎉 🛒   Exploring Sales & Customer Insights with Power BI 📈

I’ve created an interactive Power BI dashboard that focuses on understanding customer purchasing behavior and revenue trends, using data modeling, DAX calculations, and engaging visuals to turn raw sales data into actionable insights.

🚀 Highlights:
• Built a structured data model by connecting customers, products, orders, and payment data for complete sales analysis.

• Used DAX measures to calculate Total Revenue, category-wise performance, and customer-level insights.

• Implemented interactive slicers to analyze data by category, location, gender, and time period.
• Designed visualizations using KPI cards, charts, maps, and treemaps to clearly show purchasing patterns.
